Here is my learning about the linux and all the commands.

so first command from my list is 'mkdir' is used to create directories or in simple language we can say FOLDER.mkdir stands for "make directory".If want to create directory inside the directory than use 'mkdir test/tast1' 
or if you want to creat inbetween then use 'mkdir -p test/middle/test1' 

2nd command from my list is 'ls' command which is used to list all the file in folder/directories and if we use 'ls -a' command than we can see all the hidden files in the directory.And if we use 'ls -R' we can see all the sub directories files also.

Next command is 'pwd' which usually prints the curent working directory path, start from the root.
like: /mnt/d/Vamshi

'cd' command used for change the directory or change the floder.if we use 'cd .'it mean current directory and 'cd ..' means change to previous directory.
'cat' command prints the content of the file in the terminal.we can create a file by using 'cat > name.txt' command.And 'touch' command also do the same thing.example touch name.txt
'cp' command used to cope content of file into new file.Example cp <existing file name> <new file name> 
'mv' command genrally used for move files to diffrent folder and also you can rename the files also.
'rm' is used for remove file from the system permantly.And if you want to delete a directory than you can use 'rm -R<name of folder>'.
Next command is 'sudo' which allows you to run program with the security or in simple word only admin can use this command.
'df' commend tell us about the disk storage like how much free space is available.And you want to see more clearly than you can use 'df -h' command.
And 'du' command tell us how much a file is taking the storage.

Let's talk about file permission, There are 3 types of permission i.e read, write and execute. to check the file permission you can type 'ls-l' And if want to change the file permission then you can use 'chmod u=rwe,g=re,o=rw <file name>' or use binary number to change permission, like 'chmod 777 <file name>' note 4=read,2=write and 1=excute.
'chown' is used to change the owner or user. for example 'sudo chown root <file name>'
For Performing an action on Multiple File use 'find . -type f -name "*.txt" -exec re -f {} +'
The above command is for deleting all file with excetion .txt
'grep' is a command-line utility for searching plain-text data sets for lines that match a regular expression.
Example:
